# Multi-Class Classification for Medical Data

This project aims to categorize medical data into 7 distinct classes:

- 'non-tumor': 0
- 'adenocarcinoma': 1
- 'hematopoietic': 2
- 'squamous cell carcinoma': 3
- 'melanoma': 4
- 'neuroendocrine carcinoma': 5
- 'sarcoma': 6
- 'urothelial carcinoma': 7

We have adopted two different approaches to achieve this classification task:

## Approach 1: Neural Network Models

In this approach, data collected from the University Clinic Hospital will be classified using neural network models. These neural network models need to be appropriately trained to categorize the data into the 7 different classes. This method requires a suitable training dataset and a training process for the neural networks to recognize different samples.

## Approach 2: Pre-trained Model

In the second approach, we will utilize a pre-trained model that has been trained using publicly available data collected from the University of Michigan. This pre-trained model generally possesses knowledge about various features and can assist in recognizing patterns and common characteristics among the data. With this pre-trained model, we can examine the classification task.
